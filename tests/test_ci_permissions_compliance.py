"""Compliance guard for the `permissions:` scopes declared in `ci.yml`.

Fleet Monitor flagged `ci.yml` as DEGRADED (issue #96) on a 1/2 failure rate. The
sole failing run ([`31516657667`]) was a **startup failure**, not a test flake:
`created_at == updated_at`, zero jobs, and GitHub's "this run likely failed because
of a workflow file issue" banner. At that commit the `build-and-test` job declared::

    permissions:
      contents: read
      administration: read   # <- not a valid GITHUB_TOKEN permission scope

`administration` is **not** one of GitHub's accepted `GITHUB_TOKEN` permission keys,
so GitHub rejected the workflow at parse time and failed the run before any job
started. Because a startup failure is surfaced *before* branch filters are applied,
it produced a failed `ci.yml` run even though `on.push.branches` is `[main]`.

This guard pins that every key in every `permissions:` block of `ci.yml` is a
documented `GITHUB_TOKEN` scope, so an invalid scope is caught in-suite (at PR time)
instead of as a red startup-failure run.

Ref: https://docs.github.com/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs

Like ``test_ci_compliance.py`` / ``test_ci_resilience.py`` this is a text-based check
so it runs with only ``requirements.txt`` installed (no YAML parser in CI).
