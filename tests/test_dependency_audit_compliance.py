"""Compliance test for the pip-audit requirements file the dependency-audit
workflow depends on.

``.github/workflows/dependency-audit.yml`` is a thin caller stub adopted verbatim
from the org standards; all logic lives in the reusable workflow
(``petry-projects/.github`` → ``dependency-audit-reusable.yml``). That reusable's
``pip-audit`` step installs its tooling with::

    pip install --require-hashes --only-binary :all: -r scripts/pip-audit-requirements.txt

so the audit job is only green when ``scripts/pip-audit-requirements.txt`` exists
and is valid for ``--require-hashes`` mode (every requirement pinned to an exact
version and carrying at least one SHA-256 hash, with ``pip-audit`` itself pinned).

Issue #68 (Fleet Monitor) flagged a dependency-audit failure whose sole failing
run errored with ``Could not open requirements file: ...
'scripts/pip-audit-requirements.txt'`` — the file was transiently absent. This
guard is a local regression check so that file cannot silently disappear or lose
its hashes between org audits. The stub workflow must not be edited (its trigger
events, ``uses:`` line, and job name are a required status check), so the invariant
is enforced here instead.

It is text-based so it runs with only ``requirements.txt`` installed (no YAML or
packaging parser needed), mirroring ``test_ci_compliance.py`` and
``test_gitignore_secrets_compliance.py``.
