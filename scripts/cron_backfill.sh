# Unattended, resumable backfill of your full BroodMinder history, for cron.
#
# The API is capped at ~1000 calls/day, so a large account's "beginning of time"
# pull spans several days. This script is idempotent + budget-aware: safe to run
# repeatedly. Once every hive is back-filled to its start, runs become cheap
# no-ops (cached windows + stop-after-empty short-circuit). Logs to
# data/cron_backfill.log.
#
# Install (every 6h, to catch the daily quota reset whenever it falls):
#   ( crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "20 */6 * * * /ABS/PATH/TO/scripts/cron_backfill.sh" ) | crontab -
# Remove later with: crontab -e   (delete the broodminder line)
#
# Adjust --start to before your oldest data, and --end to where your normal
# (forward) extraction already begins, so the two don't overlap.
